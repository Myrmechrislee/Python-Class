# 11. translate if christophe_age is 17 then run() to code. 

# 12. translate to code: if banana_age is less than apple_age then print "Banana is younger", otherwise print "apple is younger"

#13. translate to code: if jenny_age is less than or equal to 4 then run function block with argument "Jenny",
# otherwise, if jenny_age is less than 12, run function warn with argument "Jenny",
# otherwise run function allow with argument "Jenny". 

#14. translate to code: if height is less than 160, print "Short".
# or else, if height is less than 190, print "Average".
# otherwise, print("Tall")

#15. Define a function f1 with argument x.
# If x is less than or equal to -2, return the y value of y=2x - 3
# Otherwise if x is less than 0, return y value of y=(x - 3) ^ 2 - 3
# Otherwise if x is less than 5, return y value of y=-x^2 + 3
# otherwise, return the y value of y=-5x + 3

#16. Define a function login that takes no args. 
# The function asks the user via commandline for a password. 
# If the password is "buzz123" then print "Welcome", otherwise print("Incorrect password") and run login again. 

#17. Define a function called ask_age with the arg return_type. 
# The function first asks the user for their age. 
# If return_type is "string" then return the age as string. 
# Otherwise if return_type is "float", return age as a float. 
# Otherwise if return_type is "none", return None. 
# Otherwise, return age as an int. 

#18. Define a function called compare_types with args a and b. 
# if the type of a is NOT the same as the type of b, print "a is not the same type as b" (use the type function to find the type of an object)
# otherwise, print "a is the same type as b"

#19. Define a function called is_inside_rect that takes the the args rect_x, rect_y, rect_width, rect_height, x, y. 
# If x is greater than the left bound of the rect (rect_x - rect_width / 2) and less than the right bound of the rect (rect_x + rect_width / 2),
# and y is greater than the lower bound of the rect (rect_y - rect_height / 2) and less than the upper bound of the rect (rect_y + rect_height / 2),
# then print "x is inside the rectangle" and return True
# otherwise print "x is outside the rectangle" and return False

#20. Create a function called compare_names which takes the arguments, name1 and name2. 
# If name 1 is the NOT the same as name 2 check then run the following:
# - print "name 1 is are the same as name 2"
# - If name 1 is longer than name 2 (use len function to find the length of the names), print "name 1 is longer than name 2".
# - else, if name 1 and 2 are the same length, print "name 1 and name 2 are the same length".
# - else print "name 2 is longer than name 1"
# otherwise, print "name 1 and name 2 are the same"
