#1. define a function called calc that inputs x, and RETURNS the y value of y=3x+4

#2. define a function called fahrenheit_to_celsius that inputs a float 'fahrenheit' and returns the celsius tempreture in float. 

#3. define a function called celsius_to_fahrenheit that converts a float 'celsius' to temperature fahrenheit

#4. define a function text_to_num that converts a string argument "text" into a float and returns it.  

#5. define an add function which adds two objects from args (args is short for arguments) a and b together and returns it. 

#6. define a function called add_texts that asks the users via commandline for 2 texts and returns the texts added together. 

#7. define a function called get_height which takes no arguments, asks the user for their height via commandline and then returns the height as a float. 

#8. define a function get_temp_C that takes no arguments.
# it asks the user for the temperature in fahrenheit, 
# turns it into a float, 
# converts it into the temperatue in celsius (using the function fahrenheit_to_celsius function defined earlier),
# and returns the temperature in celsius

#9. define a function convert_F_to_C that takes no arguments,
# it asks the user for the temperature in Celsius, 
# turns it into a float, 
# converts it into the temperatue in fahrenheit (using the function celsius_to_fahrenheit function defined earlier),
# prints the temperature in celsius,
# and returns True (which represents executed successfully)

#10. define a function called introduce that takes the string argument "name".
# It prints the introduction "Hello my name is {name}. I am currently 16. Nice to meet you!",
# and returns nothing
